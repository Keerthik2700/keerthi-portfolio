# Portfolio Website

This is my personal portfolio website built using **React.js** and **Tailwind CSS**.  
It is meant to showcase my **profile summary, skills, work experience, education, and selected certifications** in one place.  
The project also helped me practice React and Tailwind, and learn how to deploy a React project publicly.

## How I Built It
1. Created the React app using `create-react-app`.  
2. Installed and configured **Tailwind CSS**.  
3. Built the sections inside `App.js`: header, hero, profile summary, skills, experience, education, certifications, footer.  
4. Styled using Tailwind utilities (flexbox, grid, gradients, shadows, hover effects).  
5. Deployed to **GitHub Pages** using `gh-pages`.

- Creating a responsive layout using Tailwindâ€™s grid and flex utilities.  
- Using React hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`) for UI interactions.
